                <p>A table is a data structure that organizes information into rows and columns. It can be used to both
                    store and display data in a structured format. For example, databases store data in tables so that
                    information can be quickly accessed from specific rows. Websites often use tables to display
                    multiple rows of data on page. Spreadsheets combine both purposes of a table by storing and
                    displaying data in a structured format.</br>
                    Databases often contain multiple tables, with each one designed for a specific purpose. For example,
                    a company database may contain separate tables for employees, clients, and suppliers. Each table may
                    include its own set of fields, based on what data the table needs to store. In database tables, each
                    field is considered a column, while each entry (or record), is considered a row. A specific value
                    can be accessed from the table by requesting data from an individual column and row.</br>
                    Websites often use tables to display data in a structured format. In fact, HTML has a (table) tag,
                    as well as (table row-tr) and (table data-td) tags for specifying rows and columns. Since
                    many tables use the top row for header information, HTML also supports a tag used to define the
                    cells in the header row (th). By including tables in a webpage, large
                    amounts of data can be displayed in a easy-to-read format. In the early days of HTML,
                    tables were even used to construct the overall layout of webpages. However, cascading
                    style sheets (CSS) are now the preferred means of designing webpage layouts.</br>
